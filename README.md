# WebProject-OnlineRecordSubmission

To solve the problems of student as well as staff members this project is developed. Faculty may be busy with their own work when the student comes to correct his observation. At the same time student may be having his own work when faculty is free. 

### This software is a simple solution for all these inconvenience
This is bit simple. Student has to submit his/her observation along with the snapshots via this portal. Faculty will review the students submission and he may decline or accept your submission.
This software will allow the students to track the current status of the submitted observation. There are 3 status pending, accepted and declined. If declained then student has to resubmit the observation. Faculty can also comment on the mistake/quality that he/she made when declining/accepting the submission.
